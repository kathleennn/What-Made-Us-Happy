This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Fall 2018

+ Projec title: What Made Us Happy?
+ This project is conducted by Rui Zhang(rz2406)

+ Project summary: In this project, I conducted a brief study of what makes people in their everyday life. I used some techniques of texting mining, analyzing key words of the happy moments. The results showed that a large group of people are happy because of "friend". The happy moments are different for people in different life stages.
